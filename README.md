# Docker Roadmap

Thank you for the interest in Docker and our products!
This is the public roadmap for Docker Products and Services (Hub, Desktop, Engine, docker-compose, Docker App).

# Introduction
We want to share with our customers what we plan to do early and often so we can get your feedback on if these are the right things for us to be focusing on. This also allows our customers to make early decisions based on what we are/are not building. 

[See the roadmap »](https://github.com/docker/docker-roadmap/projects)

[Contribute to our roadmap »](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD)

## Early Access to features 

For users of Docker Desktop we provide early access to new features through our Docker Desktop Edge channel. 

Issues tagged In Preview for Docker Desktop on the public roadmap are available in the Edge Channel. 

For Docker Engine and docker-compose we have a release candidate program that allows users to get early access to versions of Docker engine & docker-compose with new features and changes. Issues tagged In Preview for Docker Engine & docker-compose on the public roadmap are available in the RC versions of each product.

Note: depending on release timings Docker Desktop may have the RC engine and/or docker-compose, please check the release notes for Docker Desktop to verify the current version in Edge

# FAQs

**Q:** Is everything on the roadmap?

**A:** Almost everything related to features, we might keep the odd feature a surprise if we really aren’t sure about it. We also won’t be tracking all of our bugs here, we have separate repos for these:

* [Docker Hub](https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback)
* [Docker Engine](https://github.com/docker/for-linux)
* [Docker Desktop Windows](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues)
* [Docker Desktop Mac](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues) 

**Q:** What do the roadmap categories mean?
* Shipped - Hopefully you are enjoying it! Give us feedback on how it is working!
* Developer Preview/Edge - For Docker Desktop Only - In developer preview on the Docker Desktop Edge Channel. See links above for where to find it!
* Almost There - We are applying the finishing touches. Things in this bucket you can expect to be shipped within 2-4 weeks. 
* We're Writing the Code - Actively in development, we are trying to get this out to you in a good state as soon as we can.
* Investigating - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still designing, or thinking through how this might work. This is a great phase to send how you want to see something implemented! We'd love to see your usecase or design ideas here.

**Q:** Why are there no dates on your roadmap?

**A:** Because we know things change and we want the room to do the right thing by fixing security issues as they come up or helping people out where they need. This means we might have to change our priorities and don’t want to let people down. 

**Q:** How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?

**A:** Please open an issue in this repo! If the issue is a bug or security issue, please follow the separate instructions above.

**Q:** How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?

**A:** Please open an issue! You can read about how to contribute [here](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD). Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.

**Q:** Will you accept a pull request?

**A:** We haven't worked out how pull requests should work for a public roadmap page, but we will take all PRs very seriously and review for inclusion. Read about contributing. We review these each week.
